          <summary>Fights inflammation at the root</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>As a 5-HT2A agonist, psilocybin shows <strong>potent anti-inflammatory effects</strong> at sub-hallucinogenic doses — reducing TNF-alpha-mediated inflammation in mice (Nichols et al., 2017). This is being clinically investigated for <strong>neuroinflammation</strong> and other inflammatory conditions. These properties may contribute to benefits in depression (neuroinflammation hypothesis), autoimmune conditions, and age-related cognitive decline. More human studies are needed.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>It may protect your aging brain</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Microdosers showed improvements on the finger tap test — a measure of psychomotor speed. This effect was <strong>specific to adults aged 55+</strong>, suggesting neuroprotective benefits in ageing populations (Rootman et al., 2022). The Stamets Stack — combining psilocybin with Lion's Mane (<em>Hericium erinaceus</em>, which promotes nerve growth factor and neurogenesis in animal models) and Niacin (B3) — was associated with even greater psychomotor improvements compared to psilocybin alone. In rodent models, psilocybin promotes <strong>new neural connections and enhanced synaptic plasticity</strong>, with implications for cognitive decline, brain injury recovery, and neurodegenerative disease. It is also being investigated in preclinical Alzheimer's models for its combined anti-inflammatory and neuroplastic effects — early results are promising but human trials are in early stages.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Better sleep, fewer cravings</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Both microdosers and macrodose participants report <strong>decreasing consumption</strong> of alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, caffeine, and psychiatric medications. Users describe feeling less desire for these substances rather than forcing abstinence. A 2024 RCT (Allen et al.) found microdosing increased <strong>sleep duration by ~24 minutes</strong> the night after dosing, including increased REM sleep. Users commonly report improved sleep quality and more vivid dreams.</p>

        </details>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>What users feel in their body</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Users frequently describe feeling <strong>more physically energised</strong> and alert on microdose days, improved <strong>body awareness</strong> — noticing tension, posture, and breathing more easily — enhanced enjoyment of physical activities like hiking, yoga, and dancing, reduced <strong>chronic pain perception</strong> (reported anecdotally, not yet studied), and feeling more in tune with hunger, sleep, and natural body rhythms.</p>
          </div>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Safer than coffee or alcohol</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>A landmark 2010 Dutch study ranked psilocybin as the <strong>lowest-harm substance</strong> out of 19 assessed — below alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and caffeine. No physical dependence has been observed. 21-day daily dosing studies showed <strong>no measurable organ toxicity</strong>, and the largest controlled safety study (King's College London, 2024) found <strong>no serious adverse effects</strong> at clinical doses. Tolerance builds rapidly, making compulsive re-dosing self-limiting. Most users take it infrequently, further reducing any abuse potential — psilocybin has <strong>low addiction and dependence liability</strong>.</p>

          <summary>Nausea and mild side effects</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The most common physical challenge (<strong>18%</strong>): mild nausea, headaches, and GI upset. Often caused by the chitin in mushroom material rather than psilocybin itself — extracts and teas may reduce these effects. Temporary cardiovascular changes include ~+10–15 mmHg systolic, ~+5–10 mmHg diastolic, and ~+5 bpm heart rate. Side effects are generally infrequent, mild, dose-dependent, and short-lasting — but a concern for those with hypertension. At moderate to high doses, muscle weakness and lack of coordination are reported but typically resolve within hours.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Dosing is tricky with raw shrooms</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Tolerance builds quickly via 5-HT2A receptor downregulation — effects diminish if dosed daily or more than once per week. This is actually protective against overuse, but means protocols must include off-days. Natural mushrooms <strong>vary significantly in psilocybin content</strong> — even within the same species, batch, or individual mushroom. Precise microdosing is challenging with raw material, and accidental perceptible doses are possible.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>A heart concern worth watching</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Psilocybin is a potent 5-HT2B receptor agonist. Long-term use of other 5-HT2B agonists (fenfluramine, MDMA) has been linked to cardiac fibrosis. This has <strong>not been demonstrated for psilocybin in humans</strong>, but no clinical evidence exists either way — the theoretical risk warrants caution with frequent, long-term use. More research is needed.</p>
