          <summary>Depression relief backed by regulators worldwide</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Psilocybin therapy produces <strong>substantial reductions in depressive symptoms</strong> for major depression and treatment-resistant depression, with increased remission rates. A 2023 meta-analysis (Haikazian et al.) confirmed these findings. The FDA granted <strong>Breakthrough Therapy Designation</strong> in 2018–2019, and Australia's TGA <strong>approved psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression in 2023</strong> — the first national regulatory approval worldwide. Authorised psychiatrists can now prescribe it. Germany has established compassionate use programmes, and Canada grants access for terminal illness. Unlike conventional antidepressants that take 4–6 weeks, psilocybin therapy shows rapid onset — often within <strong>1–2 sessions</strong> — with effects lasting weeks to months.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Mood lifts that build over weeks</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>In the <strong>largest prospective psilocybin microdosing study</strong> (n=1,133 — 953 microdosers vs. 180 controls), participants showed small- to medium-sized improvements in mood and mental health over 30 days (Rootman et al., 2022). Improvements were consistent across gender, age, and pre-existing mental health status. Mood improvement was the #1 reported benefit at 26.6%. DASS-21 Depression scores dropped significantly (13.05 → 8.18, <em>d</em>=0.49), with even larger effects among those with pre-existing mental health concerns (<strong>18.85 → 11.73</strong>). Effects were stronger among females than males. Anxiety scores improved (<em>d</em>=0.34) and stress saw the largest effect (<em>d</em>=0.63), both consistent across all subgroups analysed.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Anxiety fades, even at end of life</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>A single psilocybin dose significantly reduced anxiety and depression in cancer patients, with effects lasting <strong>6+ months</strong>. Over two-thirds rated it among their <strong>top 5 most spiritually significant life experiences</strong> (Griffiths et al., 2006/2008). Patients describe a shift from dread to acceptance, a feeling of <strong>interconnectedness</strong>, and reduced fear of death. These profound psychological shifts appear durable and meaningful even years later.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Addiction chains start to loosen</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>A Johns Hopkins pilot study found <strong>80% of smokers remained abstinent at 6 months</strong> — dramatically higher than conventional methods (~35%). Both microdosers and macrodose participants report <strong>decreasing consumption</strong> of caffeine, alcohol, cannabis, and psychiatric medications — describing less need rather than forced abstinence.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Creativity, focus, and "removing the fog"</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Increased conscientiousness and emotional awareness were observed in prospective microdosers (Dressler et al., 2021), with 14.8% reporting improved focus as a top benefit. Users commonly report enhanced divergent thinking, creative output, and flow states — though controlled studies have not yet confirmed these claims objectively. Many describe feeling "more present" and more engaged with daily activities, as if <strong>"removing a fog"</strong> rather than adding stimulation.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Experiences that reshape your perspective</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Psilocybin is being formally studied for <strong>OCD, PTSD, and anorexia nervosa</strong> — early results are encouraging. 79% of participants in the Griffiths et al. studies reported increased well-being at 2+ months, with many describing lasting shifts in <strong>values, attitudes, and openness</strong> — comparable to major life events like the birth of a child. Users commonly describe a sense of <strong>ego dissolution</strong> or merging with the universe, powerful <strong>emotional release</strong> — crying, laughing, processing old trauma — vivid visual and auditory shifts, and lasting feelings of peace and clarity. Therapists working with psilocybin note that it appears to <strong>accelerate the therapeutic process</strong> rather than replace it. A commonly repeated sentiment: <strong>"It was like 10 years of therapy in one afternoon."</strong></p>

          <summary>What users feel in their mind</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Users frequently describe feeling <strong>emotionally lighter</strong> and more resilient, finding it easier to <strong>let go of negative thought loops</strong>, having more patience and empathy in relationships, feeling <strong>more connected to nature</strong> and a sense of wonder, experiencing <strong>reduced cravings</strong> for alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, and an overall sense of well-being that builds over weeks rather than appearing immediately. A recurring theme is that psilocybin doesn't "fix" problems directly, but subtly shifts perspective — making it easier to engage with therapy, meditation, journaling, and personal growth. Many describe it as a <strong>catalyst for existing intentions</strong> rather than a standalone solution.</p>

          <summary>It can amplify the darkness too</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>6.7% of microdosers reported heightened anxiety as a challenge. Negative emotions can be amplified alongside positive ones — psilocybin is an amplifier, not a selector. Despite popular claims, microdosing has <strong>not</strong> been shown to improve attention, motor responses, cognitive problem-solving, or processing speed in controlled settings. Microdosing is <strong>not FDA-approved</strong> for any condition and should not replace professional mental healthcare, medication, or therapy.</p>
          </div>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>The placebo question is real</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>In self-blinding studies, <strong>72% of participants correctly identified</strong> whether they received a microdose — complicating placebo control. Some call psychedelics <strong>"super placebos"</strong>: substances whose cultural mystique and perceptible effects amplify expectancy. A January 2026 phase 2b trial of LSD microdosing for depression was outperformed by caffeine placebo, though this was LSD-specific and not psilocybin.</p>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>Some brains should never go here</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>Psilocybin is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in individuals with a personal or family history of <strong>psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or borderline personality disorder</strong> due to risk of acute psychotic episodes. It can trigger or worsen psychotic symptoms in predisposed individuals. Psilocybin may interact with SSRIs, MAOIs, lithium, and other serotonergic medications — combining with lithium is considered particularly dangerous. Always consult a psychiatrist before combining with any medication.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="accordion-item">
          <summary>The dose makes the difference</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>At higher doses, <strong>31% of volunteers report significant fear</strong> and 17% experience transient paranoia (Griffiths et al.). These experiences are typically temporary and manageable in supported settings but can be deeply distressing without proper preparation. Psilocybin can surface buried trauma, grief, or painful memories with intense force — without proper therapeutic support, this can be destabilising rather than healing. Research on suicidality is mixed: while some studies found psilocybin therapy reduced suicidal thoughts, others found it could be <strong>destabilising and upsetting</strong> in vulnerable individuals. This remains an active area of research.</p>
